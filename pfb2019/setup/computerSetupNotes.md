# local machines

- small monitor imacs
- networked mounted drive to share large files
- students work on local machines
- install
   - iterm
   - anaconda 
   - python3
   - xcode
   - wget & curl
   - zcat & zgrep



- we always have network response errors with all the IO when using network home directories
