    "## What is interactive coding, and why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point you've been executing your code as program from the command line to achieve your final results. There are scenarios, particularly in data analysis, where you need to frequently adjust parameters to search for meaningful patterns. Running a script to change a single parameter can be time consuming, especially if you have commands that require a large amount of CPU time. Interactive coding is simply running your scripts line-by-line or in \"chunks\" so you can frequently view the output as you write.\n",
    "\n",
    "[From wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Interactive_mode_languages)\n",
    "_Interactive mode languages act as a kind of shell: expressions or statements can be entered one at a time, and the result of their evaluation is seen immediately. The interactive mode is also known as a REPL (read–eval–print loop)._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good coding practice alert!**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should **always** ensure that your code runs, and generates **expected and reproducible results**, when executed from the command line. When you code interactively, it can be easy to assign variables out of order. This is especially true for notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Lab is incredibly easy to [install with conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jupyterlab). Simply run the following command in your home directory: \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch Juypter Lab, type `jupyter lab` from your home directory. You'll notice that Jupyter Lab's built in file browser only allows you to navigate as far back as the directory you launch the app from. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Recall that conda is already installed in the Hershey lab computers. If you would like to install conda on your personal computer, you should install Miniconda, which you can find at this [link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). I _do not_ recommend installing Anaconda, as it contains many large programs that you will likely never use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between Anaconda, Miniconda, conda?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda** and **Miniconda** are _software distributions_. Software distributions are a way to deliver software from a developer to the end user. **conda** is a _package manager_. A package manager is a collection of software tools that greatly simplifies managing your programming environment. In other words, conda is responsible for installing, upgrading, and configuring every program that you decide to add to your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda contains the minimal installer for conda. It's all you need to get started with installing your own bioinformatics software on your personal computer, or on your institution's server. Anaconda also contains conda, but includes a ton additional of software that you probably won't use."

You can then copy and paste into a python script or export the python code from the notebook. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't work well for scripts that expect command line parameters (`sys.argv` or `argparse`) because there is no equivalent of a command line in notebooks. A possible workaround is to hardcode the command line parameters in your notebook and remove those lines when you convert the notebook into a script."
